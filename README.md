# PenTest-FireFox-user.js
Firefox user.js to reduce noise and allow functionality for Penetration Testing

This project is based off the work done by the User.js project: https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js

Many of the settings in that project are too restrictive for Penetration Testing. This project aims to hit a middle ground between the things a normal user would have enabled without all of the chatter normally associated with Firefox.

Feel free to fork this project and contribute adjustments as you run into testing issues.
